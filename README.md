# Dynamic-Programming

dynamic programming is a method for solving a complex problem by breaking it down into a collection of simpler subproblems. It is applicable to problems exhibiting the properties of overlapping subproblems[1] and optimal substructure. When applicable, the method takes far less time than other methods that don't take advantage of the subproblem overlap.
